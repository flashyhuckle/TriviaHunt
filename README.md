# TriviaHunt

TriviaHunt is a geolocation based game, where you reveal 'fun facts' about locations by getting near them. Different routes are created and shared by users. The goal is to get out, walk more and get to know your city. As of right now, it is a very early 'proof-of-concept' version. Updates are coming soon.
